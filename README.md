# EDA-Case-Study

This is my first repository that I have created on my GitHub profile and this repository contains a Jupyter Notebook Python file and a PDF file for a Case Study on possible Loan Defaulters.
I have only performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the dataset, provided by an anonymous bank, regarding their customer's personal and financial details. I have extrapolated a few categories of customers that are likely to default on their EMIs for their loan payment to the bank.
